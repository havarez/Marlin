Maximum nominal volumetric throughput = 6600 mm3/min (1.4 mm nozzle)
6013 mm3/min = 2500 mm of filament = 41.6 mm/sec

Wait until the temperature displayed is below 50°C before switching off the machine

Hot tighten - max temp and 3nm of torque

DEBUG
----------
Download Marlin bugfix-2.0.x to test with the latest code.
Enable DEBUG_LEVELING_FEATURE and M114_DETAIL and re-flash the firmware.
Issue the command M111 S247 to enable maximum logging.
Perform a G28 to do your standard homing procedure.
Do a G29 to probe the bed until the point of failure.

STEPPER CONNECT
// ------------

On RAMPS, one coil should connect to 1A and 1B, whereas the other coil should connect to 2A and 2B.
On the stepper, one coil is A+ and A-, the other coil is B+ and B-.
A possible wiring is A+ to 1A, A- to 1B and B+ to 2A and B- to 2B, but there are 15 other possibilities. 
The only "wrong" way is one that connects a coil of the stepper to two different coil outputs on the RAMPS 
(so connecting, for instance, A+ to 1A and A- to 2A wouldn't work)
